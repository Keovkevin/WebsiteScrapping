# WebsiteScrapping
Web scraping, web harvesting, or web data extraction is data scraping used for extracting data from websites.Web scraping a web page involves fetching it and extracting from it.Web scraping automatically extracts data and presents it in a format you can easily make sense of.Use of APIs being probably the best way to extract data from a website. Almost all large websites like Twitter, Facebook, Google, Twitter, StackOverflow provide APIs to access their data in a more structured manner. If you can get what you need through an API, it is almost always preferred approach over web scrapping.Sadly, not all websites provide an API. Let,s get started using python as our scrapping language and BeautifulSoap as a much needed simple library.
