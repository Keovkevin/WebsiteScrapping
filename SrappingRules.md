# SCRAPPING RULES

Here are a few pieces of advice:

 1.Use an API if one is provided, instead of scraping data.
    
 2.Respect the Terms of Service (ToS).
    
 3.Respect the rules of robots.txt.
    
 4.Use a reasonable crawl rate, i.e. don't bombard the site with requests. Respect the crawl-delay setting provided in robots.txt; if there's none, use a conservative crawl rate (e.g. 1 request per 10-15 seconds).
    
 5.Identify your web scraper or crawler with a legitimate user agent string. Create a page that explains what you're doing and why, and link back to the page in your user agent string (e.g. 'MY-BOT (+https://yoursite.com/mybot.html)')
    
 6.If ToS or robots.txt prevent you from crawling or scraping, ask a written permission to the owner of the site, prior to doing anything else.
    
 7.Don't republish your crawled or scraped data or any derivative dataset without verifying the license of the data, or without obtaining a written permission from the copyright holder.
    
 8.If you doubt on the legality of what you're doing, don't do it. Or seek the advice of a lawyer.
    
 9.Don't base your whole business on data scraping. The website(s) that you scrape may eventually block you, just like what happened in Craigslist Inc. v. 3Taps Inc..
    
 10.Finally, you should be suspicious of any advice that you find on the internet (including mine), so please consult a lawyer.

 Remember that companies and individuals are perfectly free to sue you, for whatever reasons they want. This is most likely not the first step that they'll take. But if you scrape/crawl their website without permission and you do something that they don't like, you definitely put yourself in a vulnerable position.
